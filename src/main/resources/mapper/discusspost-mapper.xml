            Use COUNT(id) to return the total number of posts.

            COUNT is a built-in SQL aggregate function.
            - COUNT(*)  → counts all rows (including those with NULLs).
            - COUNT(column) → counts only rows where the given column is NOT NULL.

            Since 'id' is a primary key (never NULL), COUNT(id) here is equivalent
            to COUNT(*). It ensures we are counting valid rows that meet the conditions.
